My dissertation launches two different broader research agendas. The first focuses on the effects of mobilization in revolutionary conflicts for long-run post-revolutionary inequalities, networks, and identities. I theorize and test for "bottom-up" processes of state formation rooted in mobilization. I also focus on the family as an important conduit for intergenerational transfers of benefits and networks centered on the nation-state. 

[The Pull of the Center: Inequality and Autocratic Nation Building as Legacies of Revolution in Upland Laos](/assets/pdf/TPOC_final.pdf)

**Abstract:**

> ###### This paper reveals, through inter-generational data at the individual and family levels, that the specific patterns of revolutionary conflict and wartime mobiliza- tion can shape post-conflict inequalities and transform social interests and identi- ties in enduring ways. This happens because wartime mobilization can pull in in- dividuals from peripheral groups towards the center of state power, in the process transforming these people. Economic, political, and cultural changes then spread throughout their families and broader communities. In this way, sustained vio- lent conflict has sometimes been a pivotal moment in the incorporation of so- cietal interests into autocratic coalitions. Analysis of originally collected family histories from a heavily mobilized ethnic minority area in upland Laos reveals that political and economic benefits and cultural transformations spread inter- generationally within mobilized families. Comparing similar, nearby villages, I then find persistent correlations between wartime mobilization and subsequent economic, political, and infrastructural outcomes. The coalitional effects of vio- lent, revolutionary conflict might be underappreciated in many countries around the world. These effects might help explain patterns of inequality and processes of nation-state formation.
