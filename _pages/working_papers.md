My dissertation launches two different broader research agendas. 

**1. Long-run impacts of revolutionary mobilization**

The first focuses on the effects of mobilization in revolutionary conflicts for long-run post-revolutionary inequalities, networks, and identities. I theorize and test for "bottom-up" processes of state formation rooted in mobilization. I also focus on the family as an important conduit for intergenerational transfers of benefits and networks centered on the nation-state.

**Abstract:**

> ###### This paper reveals, through inter-generational data at the individual and family levels, that the specific patterns of revolutionary conflict and wartime mobilization can shape post-conflict inequalities and transform social interests and identities in enduring ways. This happens because wartime mobilization can pull in individuals from peripheral groups towards the center of state power, in the process transforming these people. Economic, political, and cultural changes then spread throughout their families and broader communities. In this way, sustained violent conflict has sometimes been a pivotal moment in the incorporation of societal interests into autocratic coalitions. Analysis of originally collected family histories from a heavily mobilized ethnic minority area in upland Laos reveals that political and economic benefits and cultural transformations spread inter-generationally within mobilized families. Comparing similar, nearby villages, I then find persistent correlations between wartime mobilization and subsequent economic, political, and infrastructural outcomes. The coalitional effects of violent, revolutionary conflict might be underappreciated in many countries around the world. These effects might help explain patterns of inequality and processes of nation-state formation.

Two possible future lines of research emerge: first, how do such processes impact political order and regime stability? Comparative work on this question involving the countries of mainland Southeast Asia is a promising path forward. Second, how common have such bottom-up processes of state formation been in other revolutionary contexts? Could they help explain rapid expansions of state power following revolutions?

**2. Authoritarian coalitions, dynamic incentives, and institutions**

A second research agenda involves the formal modeling and empirical study of dynamic incentives in authoritarian coalitions. In another paper from my dissertation, I argue that institutional change during the third wave of democratization can be more parsimoniously understood by accounting for the impact of economic shocks on authoritarian coalitions. This studies authoritarian institutions in the historical context of the 1970s and 1980s, when they steadily emerged across the world, in a range of country contexts.

**Sovereign debt, democratization, and authoritarian institutions in the third wave** (draft available on request)

**Abstract**

> ###### Much analysis of democratization has focused on the effect of the end of the Cold War on bringing about a period of dramatic transition from autocracy to democracy and to hybrid regimes in countries around the world. Yet data suggests a remarkable continuity in trends towards democratization from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. Additionally, though overlooked in existing literature, a steady trend towards greater institutionalization took place among autocracies from 1977 to the mid 1980s. I argue that both the third wave of democratization and the global move towards autocratic insti- tutionalization were rooted in the weakness of many autocracies in building coalitions and managing social and factional conflict domestically in the context of deep external economic shocks. I formalize the idea that high levels of social conflict place increasing budgetary demands on regimes as they build social coalitions to block oppositions and stay in power. I go on to show how the very possibility of budgetary shocks can then cause autocratic coalitions to unravel in the ab- sence of mechanisms of credible commitment. This happens because actors choose to launch favorable rebellions rather than risk unfavorable future rebellions launched by others.I empirically investigate key hypotheses by analyzing macroeconomic data as well as data on opposition events, cabinets, and institutionalization. In the pro- cess, I also present an account of authoritarian institutions rooted in the global history of institutionalization, where institutions emerge to avert coalitional unraveling during times of regime weakness.
