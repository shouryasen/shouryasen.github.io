***Action and Inheritance: Mobilizational Paths to Revolutionary Transformation***

*Book project, in progress*

> "Mobilization is modernization"

What did the rural revolutionary conflicts of the twentieth century do to the societies they swept through? This book offers a new understanding of revolutionary transformation, arguing that revolutionary mobilization---the wartime recruitment of ordinary people into revolutionary political organizations---was a fundamental and overlooked source of social change in revolutionary conflicts, whether the revolutionaries ultimately won or lost. In cases where revolutionaries took power, mobilization was at the heart of the "communist route to modernity:" pulling rural people into new organizations, networks, and identities that transformed their relationship to the state. This created loyalty, or intrinsic motivations, and altered principal-agent relationships. We see traces of these effects even where revolutionaries were defeated.

Drawing on original genealogical data collected through community partnerships in Laos and Thailand, the book illustrates how mobilization during violent conflicts reshaped inequalities, social networks, and relationships between states and societies across generations. Mobilization conferred skills and networks that persisted long after conflicts ended. These were transmitted through families and communities to descendants who never experienced the revolution directly, facilitating an expansion of the scope of interactions between states and societies.

The book develops this argument through a paired comparison of revolutionary victory and defeat: Laos, where the communist Pathet Lao prevailed, and Thailand, where the Communist Party of Thailand was defeated. By examining both winners and losers, and both successful and failed revolutions, the book conceptualizes the politics of mobilization in rural revolutionary conflict as a transformative force in its own right, which then shaped politics in two different institutional settings after conflict. The theoretical framework then provides traction on a wide range of global cases.
