  abstract={We examine the evolution of fishing rights in colonial Bengal through a series of cases heard at the Calcutta High Court in the 1880s and culminating in the passage of legislation in 1889.We posit an implicit relational contract between the colonizing British and the landowning class in colonial Bengal as a way to understand the concurrent evolution of fishing rights and institutions of governance in the region.The system of incentives created by this contract determined the development of fishing rights at a crucial moment in the history of colonial Bengal and, more broadly, became a primary mechanism of institutional change in the region.The analysis also shows the High Court to have acted, albeit in vain, as a truly independent judiciary; had its resolution of the cases prevailed, the institutional development of the region might have been substantially different than it was.},

  author={Lambais, Guilherme and Okoye, Dozie and Sen, Shourya and Wantchekon, Leonard},

  volume={67},
  number={4},
  pages={861--883},

  publisher={The University of Chicago Press Press},
  abstract={We review research on the history of education policy in colonial sub-Saharan Africa and among the African Diaspora in the United States and Brazil through a political economy lens. While the supply of education was severely constricted in all of these cases, demand for education remained strong. Thus, even as authoritarian states have attempted to restrict educational supply for social control, the strength of the demand—and the accompanying pedagogical, organizational, and political innovations—illustrates the power of education to empower marginalized communities. Through reviewing work in economics, history, and political science, we highlight the transformative effects of formal education in Black communities as well as the centrality of Black people in demanding access to higher education and innovating new political ideas and pedagogies that saw education as a force for liberation. Governments and citizens must continue to work to correct the inherited distortions in the supply of education in Black communities in Africa as well as in the diaspora.},

  booktitle={Economics and Literature},

  abstract={We use Cheikh Hamidou Kane’s novel Ambiguous Adventure to engage literature in
political economy on education and development in Sub-Saharan Africa. We contextualize
the novel in terms of the broader historical literature on colonial education in Africa. In
light of this, we argue for theorizing formal education as a supportive factor in processes
of learning by doing. Such processes can promote innovation and facilitate local agency.
We read the novel as a testament to Africans’ quest for self-assertion in adverse
circumstances. At the same time, we problematize clear-cut distinctions between “African
tradition” and the “modern West,” instead arguing that, learning by doing, Africans created
uniquely African modernities. At the heart of our account is an understanding of agency as
grounded in intersubjective environmental engagement. Building on these themes, we also
argue that deliberative governance is another practice, with deep roots in some African
communities as suggested by the novel, that speaks to intersubjective environmental
engagement and learning by doing.},
